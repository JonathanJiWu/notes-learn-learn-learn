@ HELLO WORLD FROM C++

    #include <iostream> ==>include libraries
    int main() {        ==>Main function
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";  ==>function body
    }


@ OUTPUT

*execution
    top to down, line by line

*std::cout <<"Hello World!\n";
    std::cout ==>Standard(namespace), character output stream, pronounced "see-out"
    :: ==>scope
    << ==>operator
    "Hello World?\n" ==>is what being output, double quotes around text. \n indicates a new line.
    ; ==>end the statement

*namespace
    a set of signs(names)that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds.


@ PATTERN
    
*/n
    can print out several lines with one fucntion

@ COMPILE AND EXECUTE

*C++ is a compiled language, source code => compile => machine code => execute.

*compile
    turn/translate source code into machaine code

*g++
    type |g++ app-name.cpp| into terminal to call on the compiler

*execute
    type |./machine-code-file-name.out| in terminal

*process
    executable file => loaded to CPU => line by line


@ NAMING EXECUTABLES
    
*name executable & output & execute
    |g++ hello.cpp -o name-of-the-executable| 
    then
    |./name-of-the-executable| to execute

*COMMENTS
    |// comments here!|
    |/*comment,
    comment,
    comment.*/|

*source code suffix
    .cpp
    .h

    VARIABLE
    =========

*declare
    name+type
    | int score; |

*strongly typed
    
*initialize
    | score = 0; |

*arthmetic Operators
    +, -, *, /, %

*print out the value of variable
    std::cout << score << "\n";

*chaining
    int age = 28;
    std::cout << "Hello, I am ";
    std::cout << age;
    std::cout << " years old\n";
    output ==> Hello, I am 28 years old
    can be written as ==> std::cout << "Hello, I am " << age << " years old\n";

    #include <iostream>
    int main() { 
    int score = 0;
    std::cout << "Player score: " << score <<"\n";   
    }

*user input
    std::cout << "Enter your password: ";
    std::cin >> password;

    cin ==>see-in
    >> ==>get from

*recompile after any changes


    CONDITIONALS
    =================

*if
    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
    int grade = 90;
    if(grade > 60){
        std::cout << "Pass\n";
    }}

*relational Operators
    ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

*else, else if

*switch statement
    switch (grade) {
    case 9:
        std::cout << "Freshman\n";
        break;
    case 10:
        std::cout << "Sophomore\n";
        break;
    case 11:
        std::cout << "Junior\n";
        break;
    case 12:
        std::cout << "Senior\n";
        break;
    default:
        std::cout << "Invalid\n";
        break;
    }    

*Operators
    &&, ||, !

    LOOPS
    ======

*While loop
*for loop

    ERRORS
    =======
*compile-time errors
    1. syntax errors
    2. type errors
